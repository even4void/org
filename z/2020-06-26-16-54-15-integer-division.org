Division is an [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Division_algorithm][iterative algorithm]] (involving to shift the result from quotient to remainder using a Euclidean measure) while addition can be performed as a succession of bit manipulation tricks. It would be interesting to check whether Newton-Raphson is still used internally for reciprocating a number.
