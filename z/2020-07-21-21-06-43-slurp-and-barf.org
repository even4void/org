* Slurping and barfing

#+FILETAGS: :lisp:

Slurp and barf refers to part of structural editing whereby we pull something into an s-expression, or conversely push out something from the s-expression. These operations can be carried out in a rightward or leftward manner. They are of course available in Emacs under the [[http://danmidwood.com/content/2014/11/21/animated-paredit.html][paredit]] package. [[https://github.com/guns/vim-sexp][Vim-sexp]] provides similar functionalities for Vi(m).

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
(a b (c d) e)

(a (b c) d e) ;; barf right
