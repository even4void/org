* Scheme and equality testing

#+FILETAGS: :scheme:

=eq?= compares object identity, which is inappropriate to compare floats. Indeed, many Schemes will store floating-point values on the heap, and represent them by a pointer into the storage. Two different floating-point operations may result in different heap allocations, but =eq?= may compare the pointers rather than the values they point to. On the other hand, =eqv?= is used to distinguish numbers by their exactness flag, while === is appropriate when we want to distinguish numbers by their value only, irrespective of exactness flag. For instance, =(eq? +inf.0 (abs (exp 1000.0)))= will return =#f=.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
(define infinite?
  (and (number? obj) (= +inf.0 (abs obj))))
#+END_EXAMPLE
