* Design and font size

#+TAGS: :typography:

Use different font sizes to create hierarchy. To create a scale of font sizes, take the base font size (say 16) and mutliply it by a fixed ratio to get more values:

16 base    = 16    4
16 * 8/9   = 14    3
14 * 8/9   = 12.5  2
12.5 * 8/9 = 11    1

This works in both direction:

16 / 8/9   = 18    5
18 / 8/9   = 20    6

Popular ratio: 15/16 (minor second), 8/9 (major second), ([1/âˆš5]/2) golden ratio, 5/6 (minor third), 4/5 (major third), 3/4 (perfect fourth).
