Marvin Minsky and Seymour Papert formed many of our atti- tudes about programming and its place in our intellectual lives. To them we owe the understanding that computation provides a means of expression for exploring ideas that would otherwise be too complex to deal with precisely. They emphasize that a stu- dent’s ability to write and modify programs provides a powerful medium in which exploring becomes a natural activity.
