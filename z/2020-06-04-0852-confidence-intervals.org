* Confidence intervals and probability statements

#+TAGS: :statistics:

Confidence intervals are not probability statements about $\theta$.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Consider this example from Berger and Wolpert (1984). Let $\theta$ be a
fixed, known real number and let $X_l$, $X_2$ be independent random variables
such that $\Pr(X_i = 1) = \Pr(X_i = -1) = 1/2$. Now define $Y_i = e + X_i$
and suppose that you only observe $Y_l$ and $Y_2$.
