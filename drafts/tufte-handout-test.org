#+TITLE: Tufte Handout sample document
#+AUTHOR: chl
#+DATE: August 2020

This document includes some of the core elements I want to use when writing handouts and short notes. Prerequisites are actually quite simple: It should be easy to include bibliographic entries from a general (or local) Bibtex database,\autocite{knuth-1984-texbook} and it should support Latex math notation right away; footnote should be managed by Org while following Tufte's conventions (=\marginpar=).[fn::Like this anonymous inlline footnote.]

* TODOs                                                                        :noexport:
** CANC Ideally I would like that =\tabular= like environment generated from Org during exporting be converted automagically to =booktabs= format.
CLOSED: [2020-08-09 Dim 19:44]
** TODO Figure hyperlink seem to jump to the wrong place (footnote number instead of figure caption).

* Testing general settings

Although some folks don't like underlined URLs in PDF documents, I like to make it explicit when there's something to click on so I will use a little hack found on [[https://tex.stackexchange.com/a/311205][Stack Overflow]]:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
\makeatletter
\patchcmd{\hyper@link@}
    {{\Hy@tempb}{#4}}
    {{\Hy@tempb}{\ul{#4}}}
    {}{}
\makeatother
#+END_EXAMPLE

Let's try some quotes. This should come up indented correctly when using the =QUOTE= or =VERSE= environment, but of course we need to beyond a single line to see this in action:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Science is what we understand well enough to explain to a computer. Art is everything else we do. --- Donald Knuth
#+END_QUOTE

The show must go on. Let's try some French literature now:

#+BEGIN_VERSE
Il y a toujours, puisque je le dis,
Puisque je l’affirme,
Au bout du chagrin
Une fenêtre ouverte,
Une fenêtre éclairée,
Il y a toujours un rêve qui veille,
Désir à combler, Faim à satisfaire,
Un cœur généreux,
Une main tendue, une main ouverte,
Des yeux attentifs,
Une vie, la vie à se partager.

  --- Paul Éluard
#+END_VERSE

* Testing Babel

** Mathematica

Let us use the following sample table and apply a =Transpose=:

#+NAME: example-table
  | 1 | 4 |
  | 2 | 4 |
  | 3 | 6 |
  | 4 | 8 |
  | 7 | 0 |

#+BEGIN_SRC mathematica :var x=example-table :results raw :exports both
  (1+Transpose@x)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
| 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 8 |
| 5 | 5 | 7 | 9 | 1 |

** Python

#+BEGIN_SRC python :results output :exports both
from random import seed, randint
seed(101)
x = sorted([randint(1, 10) for i in range(0, 9)], reverse=True)
print("Answer = value %s in sequence %s" % (x[2], x))
#+END_SRC

* Testing math

This is rough copy/pasting of one my z-notes.

The Galton-Watson process is part of branching processes. Let $X$ be a random variable (r.v.) with values in $\mathbb{N}$, and for $k\in \mathbb{N}$, $p_k = \Pr(X=k)$ and $m = \mathbb{E}(X) = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} kp_k < \infty$. Given $(X_{i,j})_{i,j\in\mathbb{N}}$ a family of r.v. with law $\mathbb{P}_X$, we define the sequence $(Z_n)_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ as follows:

$$\begin{cases}
Z_0 = 1 \cr
\forall n \in \mathbb{N},\: Z_{n+1} = \sum_{i=1}^{Z_n} X_{i,n}
\end{cases}$$

We also define $\pi_n := \Pr(Z_n=0)$ and $\mathbb{P}_{\text{ext}} := \Pr(\exists n\in\mathbb{N}, Z_n = 0)$.

The above model allows to consider a set of particles (from the same family) which are able to generate other particles. Each particle has a probability $p_k$ of generating $k$ independent particles, and this probability is fixed across generations. The children of the $n$th generation belong to the \(n+1\)th generation. The quantity $Z_n$ represents the number of particles at generation $n$. Each particle $i$ at generation $n$ has $X_{i,n}$ children ($1\le i\le Z_n$), $\pi_n$ is the probability of extinction at generation $n$, and $\mathbb{P}_{\text{ext}}$ is the probability of extinction of the population. If there exists $n$ such that $Z_n = 0$, then the population dies. In other words, the hypotheses of this model are:

- If $p_0 = 0$, then $\forall n\in \mathbb{N}*$, $Z_n \ge 1$ a.s. and $\mathbb{P}_{\text{ext}} = 0$.
- If $p_0 = 1$, then $\forall n\in \mathbb{N}*$, $Z_n = 0$ a.s. and $\mathbb{P}_{\text{ext}} = 1$.

* Testing figure environment

Again, this should be quite simple to display Fig. [[fig:emacs-screenshot]], but see below.
