fall (and raise again) of AI. Now, I came across the following thread that
sounds like we also need to consider [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning][RL]], which I learned about twenty
years ago. Go figure.

"The numbers 111, 222, 333, 444, 555, 666, 777, 888, and 999 are all evenly
divisible by 37, leaving no remainder." (via
[@pickover](https://twitter.com/pickover/status/1057092080449806336)) Using base
10 notation, a three-digit number, say $aaa$, can be written as $100\cdots a +
10\cdot a + a = a \cdot (100 + 10 + 1) = a \cdot 111$. Clearly, 111 is a divisor
of $aaa$ ($111 = 37\times 3$), but also of 222, 333, $\ldots$ Hence, all three-digit
numbers that are multiple of 111 will fit the bill.

Eusebio López Martínez).

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
In competitive programming, one has to use knowledge in algorithms and data structures to find solutions to algorithmic problems, then put those a ideas into a correct computer program that solves the problem within given time and memory constraints. This activity involves learning about a wide range of complex data structures and algorithms, and many hours of training.
