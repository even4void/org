[@pickover](https://twitter.com/pickover/status/1057092080449806336)) Using base
10 notation, a three-digit number, say $aaa$, can be written as $100\cdots a +
10\cdot a + a = a \cdot (100 + 10 + 1) = a \cdot 111$. Clearly, 111 is a divisor
of $aaa$ ($111 = 37\times 3$), but also of 222, 333, $\ldots$ Hence, all three-digit

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
In competitive programming, one has to use knowledge in algorithms and data structures to find solutions to algorithmic problems, then put those a ideas into a correct computer program that solves the problem within given time and memory constraints. This activity involves learning about a wide range of complex data structures and algorithms, and many hours of training.

Goodbye [[/post/tweetbot-3/][Tweetbot]]. I think most desktop app for Twitter are dead. I'll keep using
the iPhone app while it is still live, and a browser because why not after all!

I know nothing about Coq but I am happy that courses like [[http://www.cs.pomona.edu/~michael/courses/csci054s18/][Discrete Mathematics

[[https://xcelab.net/rm/statistical-rethinking/][Statistical Rethinking]] is still on my reading list (I know the second edition is
ready to be sold but I bought the hard copy of the first edition two years ago),
but I was reminded of Richard's nice blog posts like [[http://elevanth.org/blog/2017/11/28/build-a-better-markov-chain/][Markov Chains: Why Walk

I'm talking in a vacuum among millions of users. That's what's extraordinary

Hard time for the kids! While it has been shown that [[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-018-0506-1][digital technologies]] may
not be so much associated with well-being, teenagers also [[https://t.co/v4eq3EffMJ][need more
sleep]].

** DONE Emacs resource pack
   CLOSED: [2019-01-23 Wed 20:26]
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: emacs-resource-pack
:END:
Whenever I am looking for something about Emacs I am pretty sure I will end up
reading one of [[https://irreal.org/blog][Irreal]] blog posts. This time, I was wondering what's the better
way to sync an iCloud account using mu4e. Not that I am not happy with Apple
Mail, but I like having the possibility to work exclusively with Emacs, or to
process a bunch of emails using my preferred text-based workflow. The [[https://irreal.org/blog/?p=6119][solution]]
that seems to be working involves =mbsync=, and this looks perfectly fine to me
since I gave up on [[https://www.offlineimap.org][OfflineIMAP]] and switched to =mbsync= last year. =#emacs=

** DONE Free photo organizer
   CLOSED: [2019-01-23 Wed 20:36]
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: mylio
:END:
I don't have very strong requests from a photo manager other than allowing me to
browse them, and maybe tag or annotate them from time to time. Hence Apple
Photos meets my expectations. However, I understand that others may have more
refined requirements and many apps are available on the market. [[https://www.baty.net][Jack Baty]]
probably tested them all. In a [[https://www.baty.blog/2019/mylio-as-a-photo-organizer][recent post]], he suggested [[https://mylio.com][Mylio]] which looks like
a nice way to manage digital content without any cloud backend. I may try it at
some point.

** DONE Telegram and Amazon
   CLOSED: [2019-01-24 Thu 12:01]
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: telegram-and-amazon
:END:
Got rid of Telegram, Mendeley, Zotero, Bitly, Tumblr, Last.fm, and lastly,
Amazon (member since 2002!). What's next? 

** DONE Mu4e now even better
   CLOSED: [2019-01-24 Thu 12:07]

I was just reading [[https://vxlabs.com/2017/02/07/mu4e-0-9-18-e-mailing-with-emacs-now-even-better/][mu4e 0.9.18: E-Mailing with Emacs now even better]], and I
thought that I was a heavy user of mu4e too, but that was before they introduce
"contexts" and threaded views. I should really update my Emacs config. =#emacs=

** DONE Agenda app
   CLOSED: [2019-01-24 Thu 21:31]
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: agenda-app
:END:
Is it worth the time to investigate into this new app (2018 Apple Design Award
Winner) that I bookmarked back in December? Or should I just stand by Org mode?

** DONE Emacs and mu4e
   CLOSED: [2019-01-25 Fri 14:55]
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: emacs-mu4e-2019

I'm finally done with configuring =mu4e= for Emacs with icloud and the server that
runs this site. If only I haven't forgot to update my =.authinfo= credentials...

directly there? =#emacs=

Well, nobody seems to care about [[https://github.com/emacs-ess/ESS/issues/154][xlispstat support]] anymore. Just got a weird

Spacemacs/ESS actually autoload Julia mode. =#emacs=

:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: on-getting-things-done

I've been hanging around in this apartment for two years without going out or
seeing anyone, except a few friends. I guess that's one way to look at Getting

accomplish anything.

** DONE Elfeed
   CLOSED: [2019-01-28 Mon 21:50]
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: emacs-elfeed
:END:
It looks like [[https://github.com/skeeto/elfeed][Elfeed]] is way more handy than it was, thanks to [[https://github.com/remyhonig/elfeed-org][elfeed-org]] to
handle OPML files.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
As far as I know, outside of Elfeed there does not exist an extensible,
text-file configured, power-user web feed client that can handle a reasonable
number of feeds. The existing clients I've tried are missing some important
capability that limits its usefulness to me. 
#+END_QUOTE

Note that Spacemacs uses the key combination =g r= to update the live feed, not =G=
as mentioned in Chris' [[https://nullprogram.com/blog/2013/09/04/][tutorial]]. =#emacs=

** DONE Scientific Racket

:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: scientific-racket

I am looking for solid libraries to perform numerical computation (other than
the [[http://planet.racket-lang.org/package-source/williams/science.plt/3/1/planet-docs/science/using.html][Science Collection]] which has been partly integrated already), and more
generally scientific computing, using Racket. I got a few hits from my search
engines but this is mostly old and unmaintained stuff (e.g., [[https://github.com/danking/racket-ml][racket-ml]],
[[https://github.com/n3mo/data-science][data-science]]). This [[https://scicomp.stackexchange.com/questions/1454/using-unconventional-programming-languages-for-scientific-computation][SE thread]] is worth a read although the replies mainly point
to Julia. BTW, note that Tamas K. Papp stopped using CL for scientific
computation (and also switched to Julia) for [[https://tpapp.github.io/post/common-lisp-to-julia/][specific reasons]]. =#scheme=
