[@pickover](https://twitter.com/pickover/status/1057092080449806336)) Using base
10 notation, a three-digit number, say $aaa$, can be written as $100\cdots a +
10\cdot a + a = a \cdot (100 + 10 + 1) = a \cdot 111$. Clearly, 111 is a divisor
of $aaa$ ($111 = 37\times 3$), but also of 222, 333, $\ldots$ Hence, all three-digit

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
In competitive programming, one has to use knowledge in algorithms and data structures to find solutions to algorithmic problems, then put those a ideas into a correct computer program that solves the problem within given time and memory constraints. This activity involves learning about a wide range of complex data structures and algorithms, and many hours of training.

Goodbye [[/post/tweetbot-3/][Tweetbot]]. I think most desktop app for Twitter are dead. I'll keep using
the iPhone app while it is still live, and a browser because why not after all!

I know nothing about Coq but I am happy that courses like [[http://www.cs.pomona.edu/~michael/courses/csci054s18/][Discrete Mathematics
and Functional Programming]] are still available for free. (via [[https://twitter.com/Jose_A_Alonso/status/1086973529302728706][@Jose_A_Alonso]])

[[https://xcelab.net/rm/statistical-rethinking/][Statistical Rethinking]] is still on my reading list (I know the second edition is
ready to be sold but I bought the hard copy of the first edition two years ago),
but I was reminded of Richard's nice blog posts like [[http://elevanth.org/blog/2017/11/28/build-a-better-markov-chain/][Markov Chains: Why Walk
When You Can Flow?]], thanks to [[https://twitter.com/kaz_yos/status/1086967755692277760][@kaz_yos]].
