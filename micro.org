"The numbers 111, 222, 333, 444, 555, 666, 777, 888, and 999 are all evenly
divisible by 37, leaving no remainder." (via
[@pickover](https://twitter.com/pickover/status/1057092080449806336)) Using base
10 notation, a three-digit number, say $aaa$, can be written as $100\cdots a +
10\cdot a + a = a \cdot (100 + 10 + 1) = a \cdot 111$. Clearly, 111 is a divisor
of $aaa$ ($111 = 37\times 3$), but also of 222, 333, $\ldots$ Hence, all three-digit
numbers that are multiple of 111 will fit the bill.

Eusebio López Martínez).

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
In competitive programming, one has to use knowledge in algorithms and data structures to find solutions to algorithmic problems, then put those a ideas into a correct computer program that solves the problem within given time and memory constraints. This activity involves learning about a wide range of complex data structures and algorithms, and many hours of training.

Frank Harrell started hosting [[http://www.fharrell.com/][his own blog]] several months ago, and I followed

Department of Biostatistics, which appears to be a mix of his [[http://www.fharrell.com/tags/machine-learning/][latest posts on
this topic]]. I wish I could attend his talk as I did for his RMS workshop in
Ottawa some years ago.

the liking option is still available. If the "like" feature is going to

Whenever I am looking for something about Emacs I am pretty sure I will end up

way to sync an iCloud account using mu4e. Not that I am not happy with Apple
Mail, but I like having the possibility to work exclusively with Emacs, or to
process a bunch of emails using my preferred text-based workflow. The [[https://irreal.org/blog/?p=6119][solution]]

probably tested them all. In a [[https://www.baty.blog/2019/mylio-as-a-photo-organizer][recent post]], he suggested [[https://mylio.com][Mylio]] which looks like

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
The algebraic representation for graphical models with hidden variables leads
naturally to an interpretation of a parameterized model as a point on an
algebraic variety. Marginal probabilities are coordinates of points on the
variety. Varieties can be tropicalized, and the statistical meaning is that the
MAP prob- abilities (calculated with logarithms of the parameters) can be
interpreted as coordinates of points on the positive part of the tropical
variety.

:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: stata-versus-r

After attending months of Twitter discussion about what could be the best
software--R or Python--for data science several months ago, this is now the time
of the R vs. Stata debate, [[https://twitter.com/jepusto/status/1092255032500764673][here]] and [[https://twitter.com/jeremyfreese/status/1093209317317038081][there]]. Arguably, Stata is a paid software
and does not offer the same scripting facilities than R for some tasks, mainly
non-statistical tasks. However, what's the point? Did anyone ever mentioned the
fact that Stata has a GUI which completely mimics the command-line operations,
so that people afraid of typing commands or just interested in running a
logistic regression on a well-formed dataset can just do it in under a minute?
It is slow with some estimators or optimization approaches (e.g., =gglamm=), and
we had to wait a bit long to get full support for unicode and XLS, better
graphical rendering, etc. But the versioning system allows to repoduce any
result prior to the current version of Stata. And it does interact very well
with Stan and R, too. The question is not which software is better, the real
question is who's the end user? =#rstats= =#stata=

I think this deserves two additional remarks. First, it depends on the task at
hand: For instance, even if I prefer reading email with Apple Mail I use mu4e
under Emacs because I find it more convenient for bulk actions like archiving or
deleting a bunch of messages. Think of it a little: You just have to use your
preferred movement keys or the arrow keys and strike a key, and it's all done!
Likewise, for text editing or interacting with an REPL, I found Emacs
keybindings much more powerful than any combination of custom Services or even
TextExpander, together with using a mouse. I believe Vim users would agree as
well. Second, this does not account for people not using a mouse at all. I for
one have always been very happy with Macbook trackpad, and I come a lot slower
when I have to use a mouse, notwithstanding the fact that it is very bad
practice for the elbow and wrist. For most movement, I use the trackpad and I do
not worry much about Emacs or Vim keybindings, because there I am faster with
the trackpad. Hence, we should better clearly state what actions are better
performed using a mouse before claiming than the mouse win over the keyboard.

I mostly stopped using Markdown these days. Maybe I should just revisit some old

Though we age, it is unclear how our bodies keep track of the time (assuming they do). [[https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/acel.12897][Researchers claim that our blood cells could act as time keepers]]. When you transplant organs from a donor, they typically behave according to the age of the recipient. However, blood cells are an exception: they keep the same age as the donor. What would happen if we were to replace all blood cells in your body with younger or older ones?

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
The amount of genomic sequence data being generated and made available through
public databases continues to increase at an ever-expanding rate. Downloading,
copying, sharing and manipulating these large datasets are becoming difficult
and time consuming for researchers. We need to consider using advanced
compression techniques as part of a standard data format for genomic data. The
inherent structure of genome data allows for more efficient lossless compression
than can be obtained through the use of generic compression programs. We apply a
series of techniques to James Watson's genome that in combination reduce it to a
mere 4MB, small enough to be sent as an email attachment.

TIL. There's a nice option when you edit Python code under Emacs which consists in sorting automagically all =import= statement. In most cases, it works great, however there are some edge cases. E.g., it is common in Flask applications to have =import= defined after initializing the app itself, because of cicular imports. Hopefully, it is possible to override the default settings and to add a local directory variable, as recommended on Spacemacs website (=SPC f v d=). =#emacs=

From time to time it seems to me that's all I have left. I've read them all except the last ones I bought. However, I can understand what it's like to contemplate all that we still have to learn.

Another common trick is to throw twenty cards on to a table in ten couples, and ask someone to select one couple. The cards are then taken up, and dealt out in a certain manner into four rows each containing five cards. If the rows which contain the given cards are indicated, the cards selected are known at once.

** DONE Encoding figure name using MD5
   CLOSED: [2019-03-16 Sat 08:34]
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: md5-encode-figure-name
:END:
How about generating figure name using MD5 hash? I've long been wondering how to
store unique file names for all documents that I happen to write from day to
day. The last few years, I decided to prefix all such file names using either
=fig-= or =img-= depending on the context (i.e., whether it has been generated by a
computer program or in the case it's just an illustration grabed on the
internet), followed by a short but meaningful description, e.g.
=img-emacs-screenshot.png=. When it is a series of figures, I usually append an
index ("a", "b", ...; or zero-padded numbers). Still I have lot of duplicates
file names on my HD. One way to circumvent this issue is to generate random
hash, or I believe so since we all have the =md5= utility on Un*x systems. Here we
go: 

#+begin_src shell
current master ✗ 74db262 22h25m ✖ △ ◒  md5 -s "emacs-screenshot"
MD5 ("emacs-screenshot") = 65c9ef7d939db96dd290adcf9597d65b

quite an honest account of DS-related stuff:

#+begin_quote
Data science is the science and design of (1) actively creating a question to
inves- tigate a hypothesis with data, (2) connecting that question with the
collection of appro- priate data and the application of appropriate methods,
algorithms, computational tools or languages in a data analysis, and (3)
communicating and making decisions based on new or already established knowledge
derived from the data and data analysis.
